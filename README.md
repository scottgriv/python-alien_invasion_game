## Credit

The code in this repository was created by following a tutorial in a book I read named **Python Crash Course, Second Edition** by **Eric Matthes**; a great book that I highly recommend reading if you're beginning to learn Python programming. The book contains the basics of Python and a number of demo projects along with the source code available on GitHub (link to the main branch below) to truly learn Python in an easy to understand way.

I would like to express my gratitude to **Eric Matthes** for their contribution to this project.

To play the game, run the following commands:

```shell
cd /your_folder_path/python-alien_invasion_game
```

```shell
python3 -m alien_invasion
```
